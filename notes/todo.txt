x.Reorg as library/module

x.Should shared spritelisten to the canvas events directly?
  x.This would let all the events handlers be private

x.get rid of private member access! javascript doesn't enforce this, but we shouldn't do it!
    x.move to "#" instead of "_"

x.mouseClicked + all other mouse events

x.attach/detach lifecyle events
    x.attach (needs to be after components are connected)
        x.called "setup"
    x.detach




x.todo organize record
  .record
    .creator
    .shared
      .x
      .y
      .w
      .h
      .z


x.add broadcast event function on sharedSpriteManager.js


.init sequence
    .todo, shouldn't rely on globals for ds, spriteManager
    .add an "appName" and "roomName" to the DS connection, and use names to prefix


.rename "data" to "shared" in game object?
    .load shared onto the components
    .auto send changes (mutation observer, just check?)
    .w/ debounce in frames
    .add a send() command to send manually (instead of auto or to push an immediate in addition to auto)
    .populate data field differently

        .change name to `shared`
        .put `shared` on the components
        .components can just read e.g. this.shared.x
        .components can just write e.g. this.shared.x, changes will be shared automatically
        .add function to cause immediate sync-write
        .allow to configure sync-write frequency


.handle removing owned sprites when owner leaves automatically?



x.make it so you don't have to forward all the events from p5 handlers (install listeners from sprite manager)



.use actually unique id's for client ids

.use "#" for privates

x.remove debug_king

.MutationObserver


.vue debugmode
