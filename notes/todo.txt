x.Should shared spritelisten to the canvas events directly?
  x.This would let all the events handlers be private

x.get rid of private member access! javascript doesn't enforce this, but we shouldn't do it!
    x.move to "#" instead of "_"

x.mouseClicked + all other mouse events

.attach/detach lifecyle events
    x.attach (needs to be after components are connected)
        .called "setup"
    x.detach




x.todo organize record
  .record
    .creator
    .shared
      .x
      .y
      .w
      .h
      .z





.todo, shouldn't rely on globals for ds, spriteManager

.handle removing owned sprites when owner leaves automatically?

.populate data field differently

  .change name to `shared`
  .put `shared` on the components
  .components can just read e.g. this.shared.x
  .components can just write e.g. this.shared.x, changes will be shared automatically
  .add function to cause immediate sync-write
  .allow to configure sync-write frequency

.make it so you don't have to forward all the events

.add broadcast event function on sharedSpriteManager.js

.use actually unique id's for client ids

.use "#" for privates

x.remove debug_king

.MutationObserver


.vue debugmode
