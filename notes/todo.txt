x.Reorg as library/module

x.Should shared spritelisten to the canvas events directly?
  x.This would let all the events handlers be private

x.get rid of private member access! javascript doesn't enforce this, but we shouldn't do it!
    x.move to "#" instead of "_"

x.mouseClicked + all other mouse events

x.attach/detach lifecyle events
    x.attach (needs to be after components are connected)
        x.called "setup"
    x.detach




x.todo organize record
  .record
    .creator
    .shared
      .x
      .y
      .w
      .h
      .z


x.add broadcast event function on sharedSpriteManager.js


x.init sequence
    x.todo, shouldn't rely on globals for ds, spriteManager
    x.add an "appName" and "roomName" to the DS connection, and use names to prefix


.rework data in components
    x.rename "data" to "shared" in game object?
    x.load shared onto the components
    x.auto send changes (proxy!, ~just check?~)
    .w/ debounce in frames
    .add a send() command to send manually (instead of auto or to push an immediate in addition to auto)
        .(currentlsy "set" consider name)
    .add function to cause immediate sync-write of all pending (debounced) writes
    .allow to configure sync-write frequency
        

  .worry about deep assignments on that proxy (its not seen!)
